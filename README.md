DrowsyEye is a real-time drowsiness detection system using Python, OpenCV, and dlib's facial landmark detection. It monitors eye aspect ratio (EAR) to detect blinks and prolonged eye closure, triggering an alarm to alert users in case of drowsiness. The system is ideal for driver safety or fatigue monitoring in high-focus environments. It includes gamma correction and histogram equalization for better performance in low-light conditions. An optional video writer saves session recordings for analysis. Lightweight and configurable, it's suitable for live webcam feeds.
